    "\n",
    "This assignment will give you practice using the library PyTorch, which is a popular library for constructing deep learning models. Deep Learning is a very powerful tool because it is able to learn very complicated functions. Deep Learning has revolutionized fields like image and speech recognition. \n",

    "* Reading documentation for a modern machine learning library\n",
    "* Writing PyTorch code. \n",
    "* Evaluating neural network models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the cells provided marked `TODO` with code to answer the questions. **Unless otherwise noted, every answer you submit should have code that clearly shows the answer in the output.** Answers submitted that do not have associated code that shows the answer may not be accepted for credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure to restart the kernel and run all cells** (especially before turning it in) to make sure your code runs correctly. Answer the questions on Gradescope and make sure to download this file once you've finished the assignment and upload it to Canvas as well. **Note this assignment takes a long time to run so make sure to do this earlier than later**.\n",
